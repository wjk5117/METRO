# PCB Design of METRO's Sensor Array


## Description
This directory contains all the PCB design for METRO's sensor array.
The sensor array adopts a modular design and thus has six sigments for better extensibility and mass production.

## Design Tool and Library
We utilize Altium Designer (version 20.0.13) to design PCB boards.
The component library of capacitive and resistance adopts the standard library.
The footprint of the MLX90393 magnetometer we used, can see https://www.snapeda.com/parts/MLX90393SLW-ABA-011-RE/Melexis%20Technologies/view-part/551380/?ref=search&t=MLX90393
