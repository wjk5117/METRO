# 3D-printed Protective Shell Design for METRO Tags

## Description
This directory contains the 3D-printed shell design for protecting the cubic passive magnets used for METRO.
The diameter of each shell is 10 cm.
We provide both the STL and GCODE files for . 

- line_tag.stl: the STL file of the protective shell for 90-degree passive magnet
- line_tag.gcode: the gcode file of the protective shell for 90-degree passive magnet
- information_tag.stl: the STL file of the protective shell for 0-degree passive magnet
- information_tag.gcode: the STL file of the protective shell for 0-degree passive magnet

## Design tool
We utilize SolidWorks (version 2021) to design all STL files.
To slice the STL files to the gcode format, we use Ultimaker Cura (Version 5.4.0).
The 3D printer we used is the Creality Ender-3 S1 Pro.
