# Codes for METRO

## Arduino
- Library: Adafruit's library for the MLX90393 magnetic field sensor.
- ReadSensor: Capture time-series magnetic field data from the MLX90393 magnetometers and transmit it to the computing unit via a wired connection.

## Sensing_Pipeline
All codes for real-time detection and decoding of on-road magnetic tags.

- AMN_denoise.py: the implementation of the Adaptive Magnetic field Neutralization (AMN) algorithm to mitigate noise generated by wheel rotation.
- real_time_detecting_both_tag.py: connect to the CAN bus of a vehicle,then detect and decode both line and information tags in real time .
- real_time_detecting_info_tag.py: connect to the CAN bus of a vehicle,then detect and decode information tag in real time.
- utils.py: contains utility functions for the real-time detection process.


## Visualization
All codes for visualizing the experiment results.

## Requirements.txt
All Python package dependencies required for code execution.
