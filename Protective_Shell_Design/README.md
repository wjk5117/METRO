## Description
This directory contains the 3D-printed protective shell design for each cubic passive magnet employed in METRO system.
The diameter of the shell is 10 cm.

We provide both STL (stereolithography) and G-code files.

- line_tag.stl: The STL file for the protective shell designed for the 90-degree magnet.
- line_tag.gcode: the G-code file for the protective shell designed for the 90-degree magnet.
- information_tag.stl: the STL file for the protective shell designed for the 0-degree magnet.
- information_tag.gcode: the G-code file for the protective shell designed for the 0-degree magnet.

## Design tool
We utilize SolidWorks (version 2021) to design all the STL files.
To convert these STL files into the G-code format, we use Ultimaker Cura (Version 5.4.0) and our 3D printer is the Creality Ender-3 S1 Pro.
